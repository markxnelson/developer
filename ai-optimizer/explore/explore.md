## Task 1: Check the DB connection

Let's check if the DB is correctly connected.

1. Navigate to the *Databases* tab on the left side pane:

4. Example with inline navigation icon ![Image alt text](images/sample2.png) click **Navigation**.

5. Example with bold **text**.

   If you add another paragraph, add 3 spaces before the line.

## Task 2: Set OCI Credentials

In the *OCI* configuration tab, you can add your **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure** (OCI) credentials to authenticate with your OCI tenancy. This will enable access to objects and documents stored in your cloud compartments.

1. Navigate to the *OCI* tab on the left side pane:

2. Insert your OCI credentials. Detailed information on how to the required credentials is available in the [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm#Required_Keys_and_OCIDs).

   If you have previously created a `.oci/config` file, the framework will automatically read this file at startup and load the credentials from the Default profile for authentication. To create one, follow the instructions available in the [Quickstart Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliinstall.htm#Quickstart).

   After entering your credentials, click the Save button. If the credentials are correct, a green confirmation pop-up will appear, indicating successful authentication to your tenancy.
