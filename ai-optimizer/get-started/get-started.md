# Get started - Installation and Setup

## Introduction

The AI Optimizer is available to install in your own environment, which may be a developerâ€™s desktop, on-premises data center environment, or a cloud provider. It can be run either on bare-metal, within a container, or in a Kubernetes Cluster.

This walkthrough will guide you through a basic installation of the Oracle AI Optimizer and Toolkit (the AI Optimizer). It will allow you to experiment with GenAI, using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Oracle Database 23ai at the core.

Estimated Time: 5 minutes

### Objectives

* Perform a full on-premise installation of the **Oracle AI Optimizer and Toolkit**

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

* An Integrated Development Editor (like Visual Studio Code)
* Python 3.11 (for running Bare-Metal)
* Container Runtime e.g. docker/podman (for running in a Container)
* Internet Access (docker.io and container-registry.oracle.com)
* 100G of free disk space.
* 12G of usable memory.
* Sufficient GPU/CPU resources to run the LLM, embedding model, and database

## Task 1:  Log in to Oracle Cloud

{{% notice style="code" title="Same... but Different" icon="circle-info" %}}
The walkthrough will reference `podman` commands. If applicable to your environment, `podman` can be substituted with `docker`.
If you are using `docker`, make the walkthrough easier by aliasing the `podman` command:

`alias podman=docker`.

If you've signed out of the Oracle Cloud, use these steps to sign back in.

1. Go to [cloud.oracle.com](https://cloud.oracle.com) and enter your Cloud Account Name and click **Next**. This is the name you chose while creating your account in the previous section. It's NOT your email address. If you've forgotten the name, see the confirmation email.

4. Based on the Multi-factor authentication setup for your account, provide authentication to sign into the account. For example, click **Allow** on the app or enter your **authentication code** and click **Verify** based on the authentication setup. For more details, refer the [Managing Multifactor Authentication documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/usingmfa.htm)

    ![Click Allow in the app](./images/sso-multi-factor-authentication.png " ")

    ![Enter authentication code and click Verify](./images/sso2-multi-factor-authentication.png " ")

5. After verification, you will be signed in to Oracle Cloud!
